# 1.0.9-e-16May2023
### Automated Security Helper

* Changed YAML scanning (presumed CloudFormation templates) to look for CloudFormation template files explicitly, and excluding some well known folders
added additional files that checkov knows how to scan to the list of CloudFormation templates (Dockerfiles, .gitlab-ci.yml)
* Re-factored CDK scanning in several ways:
    * Moved Python package install to the Dockerfile (container image build) so it's done once
    * Removed code that doesn't do anything
    * Added diagnostic information to report regarding the CDK version, Node version, and NPM packages installed.
* Fixed Semgrep exit code
